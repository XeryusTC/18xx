\section{Map}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The map includes the Iberian Peninsula, or Portugal and Spain.
	\item France is the only off-board area.
	\item There are two ports: I2 (Bilbao) and A16 (South of Lisbon).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Private companies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There are 22 Private companies in total, 17 of these can be floated
	from the start of the game. The further 5 can be floated from phase 3. A
	full list can be found on page 3 of the game rules.
	\item Private companies have only one share that is owned by either a player
	or a Public company.
	
	When owned by a player:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The certificate counts towards the owning player's certificate
		limit.
		\item The revenue generated is paid directly towards the owner at the
		start of an operating round.
	\end{itemize}
	When owned by a Public company:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The income generated by the Private company is added to the
		revenue of the Public company when it operates.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Some Private companies have two revenue numbers on them. The first
	number is the revenue generated during Phase 2, the latter number is the
	revenue generated during Phase 3 and up.
	\item Private companies can not be bought or sold, they can only be acquired
	through an auction.
	\item Private companies are closed at the end of the OR when Phase 5 begins.

	\item All hexes on the map associated with a Private company are its ``home
	hexes'', these are reserved and free to build for the Private company.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Public companies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There are eight Public companies, they all operate in the same manner.
	\item Each Public company can have five or ten shares, one of these is a
	the Director share, this is a double share.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In the case of five shares: the Director share is worth 40\% of
		the Public company, the remaining three shares are all worth 20\%.
		\item In the case of ten shares: the Director share is worth 20\% of
		the Public company, the remaining eight shares are all worth 10\%.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The player who holds the greatest number of shares in a company is its
	Director, he/she also holds the Director share.
	\item If a player who is not the Director owns a greater share in the Public
	company than its current Director he swaps two of his certificates in the
	company for the Director share and becomes the new Director.
	\item If two players own an equal amount of shares in a company then there
	is no change in Directorship.
	\item The Director makes all decisions on behalf of a company, he does not
	need to listen to other shareholders.
	\item When a Public company is closed it is available to be restarted later.
\end{itemize}

\section{Company closure}
If a Public company's stock marker falls below P50 then the following happens:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The company is immediately closed without any compensation.
	\item All the company's stocks are returned to the marked board spaces.
	\item The company's stock marker and all of its station tokens are removed
	from the board.
\end{itemize}

Private companies that have not yet been closed by the end of the OR that
started Phase 5 are closed then.
